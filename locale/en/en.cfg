automatic-coupling-system=Automatic Coupling System is a mod, that lets you couple & decouple trains via the circuit network.\nThe [virtual-signal=signal-couple] tells the train to try to couple to the train beyond the [item=train-stop].\nThe [virtual-signal=signal-decouple] tells the train to decouple at the value. For example when giving it a decouple value of 2, it will count 2 from the train stop and then decouple. Same works with negative values, just in the other direction.\n\n[font=default-bold]This happens AFTER leaving a station.\nThe tutorial shows you a example.[/font]
